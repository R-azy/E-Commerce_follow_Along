# Ecommerce Follow Along Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**. This is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview
### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack
- **MongoDB**: A database for storing application data in a flexible, document-based format.
- **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logic.
- **React.js**: A frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.

### 2. REST API Structure
REST APIs allow communication between the frontend and backend. We'll create APIs for:
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps define how the data is stored and related.

### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only authorized users can access certain features. For example:
- Users must log in to place orders or view personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.

## Milestone 2
- Created a **login page** in the frontend.

## Milestone 3
- Set up **dedicated folders** for organizing backend code effectively.
- Initialized and configured a **Node.js server** to handle API requests.
- Connected the application to **MongoDB** to store and manage data.
- Implemented **basic error handling** to ensure smooth server operation.

## Milestone 4
- Created a **User Model** to define how user data is structured in the database.
- Developed a **User Controller** to manage user interactions (e.g., adding or retrieving data).
- Configured **Multer** to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.

## Milestone 5
- Built the **Sign-Up page** for user registration using **HTML and CSS**.
- Implemented **form validation** to ensure valid inputs (e.g., email format and password security).
- Enhanced **user experience** by preventing input errors.
- Committed and pushed all changes to the repository.

## Milestone 6 :
In this milestone, I created a backend signup API that securely stores user data. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before saving to MongoDB. The API ensures secure user authentication and data privacy. All changes are committed and pushed.

## Milestone 7:

In this milestone, we implemented user login authentication by validating credentials and comparing encrypted passwords using bcrypt. The process involves retrieving user data, hashing the entered password, and matching it with the stored hash. If authenticated, access is granted; otherwise, an error is returned. This enhances security and protects user data.
